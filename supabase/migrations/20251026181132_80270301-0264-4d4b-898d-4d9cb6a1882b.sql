-- Fix profiles RLS policies to work in dev mode
-- The issue: TO authenticated blocks requests when there's no real auth session
-- The solution: Use TO public and rely on WITH CHECK conditions

-- Drop the existing INSERT policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can insert profiles" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON public.profiles;

-- Recreate with TO public instead of TO authenticated
-- This allows the policies to evaluate in dev mode (unauthenticated)

-- Allow admins to insert any profile (needed for seeding test customers)
-- In dev mode: auth.uid() is NULL, so has_role(NULL, 'admin') returns true (dev mode fallback)
-- In production: auth.uid() is set, so has_role() checks user_roles table
CREATE POLICY "Admins can insert profiles"
ON public.profiles
FOR INSERT
TO public
WITH CHECK (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role));

-- Allow authenticated users to insert their own profile (needed for signup)
-- In dev mode: this won't match, but the admin policy above will allow it
-- In production: this allows users to create their own profile during signup
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
ON public.profiles
FOR INSERT
TO public
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
